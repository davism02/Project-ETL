In this project, we will pull datasets from data sources (Kaagle, gunviolencearchive.org, and  census.gov) on gun violence by comparing it to social economics using census data.  The data will be subset to look at other variables such as trends by date, state, the number killed or injured.   
For census data, we will look at 2010 and 2020.  We will preprocess data, extract, transform and then load to database.

Extract

For the given ETL project, our original three sets of data. The first dataset was on gun violence from 2013 - 2018. This data had over 260,000 rows and 29 columns.  The data included information such as, gun type, participant age, state, and description of incident, etc.  The second data set was on Poverty data by state subset for race and ethnicity.  The third data set was from population data for United States by State.
